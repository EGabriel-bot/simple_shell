## Simple Shell Project

## Description
This project is a simple version of the Unix shell command interpeter.

## What is the shell?
Shell is a UNIX term for the interactive user interface with an operating system. The shell is the layer of programming that understands and executes the commands a user enters. In some systems, the shell is called a command interpreter.

*Example of the use of the shell:*

## Prototype
`int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

**- Format is a string of characters. This string represents whatever we want to write.

- Return: The amount of characters printed except the null byte.

- Write output to stdout, the standard output stream.**

## Compile
Every file that composed the whole project is compiled using the following flags:

`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra - pedantic`

## Testing

We have tested our simple shell extensively and it has some bugs.

## Output
